There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python which can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/). The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3..

# Project Motivation <a name='Motivation'></a>

A big part of my project motivation was to better understand Airbnb's business and see how it preforms in a near by major city such as Seattle.There where some key questions I truly wanted to understand.

1. How often are residences occupied and how does this vary with the price?
2. Which are the key relationships that help to predict our review scores?
3. Can we predict if a house will receive a 'good' score?

The full data sets related to this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or directly at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). Also, I want to encourage pull requests and further analysis on top of this project!

I have compiled all the analysis into one single notebook titled Seattle's Airbnb Analysis that answers all of the previously mentioned questions.

Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Thanks must go to Airbnb for creating this data set and allowing me to use it for this analysis.

Also, I would like to acknowledge Udacity for helping provide the skills and data science background that allowed me to complete my first 100% solo project.
